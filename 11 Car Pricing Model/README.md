Car Pricing Model

This notebook explores a dataset from kaggle containing data on 426,000 used cars listed for sale. The goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive for my client, a used car dealership. The results of the analysis are presented as recommendations as to what consumers value in a used car and a pricing model froecasting the sales price of new listings. The analysis was conducted using the CRISP-DM framework. The data mining goals are to a) identify the most valuable attributes of used cars, and b) predict the sales price of a vehicle.
